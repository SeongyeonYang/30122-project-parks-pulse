Rinse the container two times with sample water and then sample from a similar depth as above. Fill the container completely. Avoid collecting disturbed sediment. Replace the lid and lift the container out of the water. Dry the container thoroughly and label with project name, sample ID, sample date, sampled by, sample time, preservative (ice), grab sample, and analysis requested (pest/PPCP, waste).

All bottles are triple rinsed with stream water prior to filling. All crew wear nitrile gloves. Water is collected in the thalweg with a isokinetic technique with bottles filled facing upstream and plunged in a smooth even motion from the surface to the bottom substrate. Filtration is conducted on site or within 24 hours as needed. Fine mineral sediment is composited from 7 to 11 representative areas near the location where water is sampled.
