Replace the lid and lift the container out of the water. Dry the container thoroughly and label with project name, sample ID, sample date, sampled by, sample time, preservative (ice), grab sample, and analysis requested (pest/PPCP, waste). Repeat the above procedure until the appropriate number of samples have been collected. Use new or clean gloves when collecting each additional sample. Prepare or collect duplicate samples as necessary for quality control. After collection all samples will be immediately placed in a cooler with wet or Blue ice and kept cool until delivered to the laboratory. If samples must be stored temporarily, they should be refrigerated at 4.5ยบ C or lower to prevent microbial degradation. Samples will be shipped via UPS overnight service to the laboratory.
