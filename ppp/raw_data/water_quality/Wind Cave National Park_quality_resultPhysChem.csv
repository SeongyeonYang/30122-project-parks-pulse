The suction-lift sampling is the preferred method to reduce human contamination in cave water bodies.  These collection methods are described in the USGS National Field Manual Collection of Water Samples (USGS 2006).  Suction-lift sampling was done with a peristaltic pump (1 to 2 liter/minute pumping rate) at sites with less than 25 feet of water depth by lowering the pump intake to the desired depth and pumping about three sample tubing volumes to field rinse the sample tubing before collecting the actual sample.  When suction-lift sampling wasn't possible, dip (grab) sampling was done with a hand-held, narrow-mouth bottle with the sampler standing downstream during filling.

The suction-lift sampling is the preferred method to reduce human contamination in cave water bodies.  These collection methods are described in the USGS National Field Manual Collection of Water Samples (USGS 2006).  Suction-lift sampling was done with a peristaltic pump (1 to 2 liter/minute pumping rate) at sites with less than 25 feet of water depth by lowering the pump intake to the desired depth and pumping about three sample tubing volumes to field rinse the sample tubing before collecting the actual sample.  When suction-lift sampling wasn't possible, dip (grab) sampling was done with a hand-held, narrow-mouth bottle with the sampler standing downstream during filling.

These collection methods are described in the USGS National Field Manual Collection of Water Samples (USGS 2006).  Suction-lift sampling was done with a peristaltic pump (1 to 2 liter/minute pumping rate) at sites with less than 25 feet of water depth by lowering the pump intake to the desired depth and pumping about three sample tubing volumes to field rinse the sample tubing before collecting the actual sample.  When suction-lift sampling wasn't possible, dip (grab) sampling was done with a hand-held, narrow-mouth bottle with the sampler standing downstream during filling.

Suction-lift sampling was done with a peristaltic pump (1 to 2 liter/minute pumping rate) at sites with less than 25 feet of water depth by lowering the pump intake to the desired depth and pumping about three sample tubing volumes to field rinse the sample tubing before collecting the actual sample.  When suction-lift sampling wasn't possible, dip (grab) sampling was done with a hand-held, narrow-mouth bottle with the sampler standing downstream during filling.
