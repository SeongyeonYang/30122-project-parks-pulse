11NPSWRD_WQX,National Park Service Water Resources Division,11NPSWRD_WQX-MACA_ERES,Echo River Spring,Spring,"The Echo River karst groundwater basin, the type locality of the Kentucky Cave Shrimp, is almost entirely contained within park boundaries - 22.2 km2 of its 23.2 km2 are within the park.  However, it does receive a large portion of its recharge from the adjacent Turnhole Spring basin (primarily agricultural lands) during periods of high flow.  Research has allowed us to determine when, relative to stage condition, this overflow route is activated (Meiman and Ryan 1992).  Water quality from this station is excellent during periods of low flow, but water quality is severely degraded during and immediately following high flow when the overflow route is active.  There also exists a condition where if the stage of the Green is within 1.5-3 meters above base level, and the karst aquifer is in a stage of low discharge, a flow-reversal occurs.  River water enters (at rates of over one cubic meter per second) River Styx Spring, flows into Mammoth Cave, and out Echo River Spring (total distance underground of about two kilometers).  During these conditions, which occur for several weeks during the winter months), the recharge area of Echo River Spring is the entire Green River watershed upstream of River Styx Spring.  Water quality signatures are obvious in low flow, overflow, and flow reversal states.",05110001,,,,,37.1790541100,-86.1086827600,,,,GPS Code (Pseudo Range) Differential,NAD83,,,,,,,US,21,061,,,,,,,,,,STORET
