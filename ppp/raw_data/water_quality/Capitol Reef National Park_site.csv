11NPSWRD_WQX,National Park Service Water Resources Division,11NPSWRD_WQX-CARE_FISH2021_PC1,Pleasant Creek Reach 1,River/Stream,"Pleasant Creek originates in the high country on Boulder Mountain, west of the park. It is a tributary of the Fremont River and flows east through the park, approximately parallel to Oak Creek, before joining the Fremont River at separate confluences, east of the park boundary. The Fremont River and the Muddy River join to form the Dirty Devil River, a significant tributary of the Colorado River.  Historically the natural hydrology of each stream was independent of the other, each characterized by high flows in spring from melting snow on Boulder Mountain, lower summer baseflows intermixed with large flood events originating from summer rainstorm runoff from the impervious rock of the lower elevation desert, and low winter baseflows. Both streams likely had continuous flow to the Fremont River for much of the year, though they were perhaps discontinuous during periods of drought.  However, at this time, the flows of Pleasant Creek and Oak Creek are hydrologically connected by considerable water management infrastructure that exists throughout their watersheds, and the baseflows of each are now highly modified by irrigation diversions to, and releases from Lower Bowns Reservoir that are determined by downstream irrigation demands.  Consequently, baseflows within the park may be both seasonally higher or lower than they were historically, and there is evidence that at sometimes of the year, both streams may experience extremely low flows and/or intermittent drying. Currently, both streams are hydrologically disconnected from the Fremont River for large periods of the year. A low head diversion grade control structure also exists on Pleasant Creek, just outside the eastern boundary of the park, below the actual Notum Diversion, but it is unknown if it is a barrier to upstream fish movement.
