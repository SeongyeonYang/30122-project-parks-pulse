            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
This project aims to analyze the U.S. National Parks System (NPS) and other open-sourced datasets to construct a composite measure of individual parks’ health status, 
called the Park Health Index (PHI). To compute PHI, we will examine and assign appropriate weight to different aspects of a park’s current state, including park usage, climate data, park management, and hazards. 
From individual time series data by parks unit, we are also interested in exploring trends in visitation and impact of climate change among parks over 10 years (2011-2022).
Our analysis unfolds in three main sections: </p> 
            <ol type=1>
                <li> Trend and Correlation Analysis: Providing a snapshot of park characteristics.</li> 
                <li> Regression Analysis: Exploring the relationship between DMR, visitation, and spending. </li> 
                <li> Factor Analysis: Identifying underlying factors that influence park health.</li>

            <h2>1. Trend and Correlation Analysis</h2>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                    <figure style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
                        <img src="/Users/yihuai/Documents/yihuai/uchi/winter/capp30122/30122-project-parks-pulse/ppp/analysis/visualizations/Total Fire Occurrences Trend Over the Years of All Parks.png" alt="Climate Spending and Visitation Graph" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
                    <figcaption>Figure 1. Total Fire Occurrences Trend Over the Years</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
            <p>Fire occurrences see an overall declining trend over the 10-year period (2011-2022), peaking in 2014 with roughly 120 fires occurred in national parks before decreasing to 77 fires in 2022. 
            While not shown on this graph, we find that while the size of fires does not necessarily trace this trend, fluctuating with no clear patterns, the overall acres burnt across all parks did take on a downward turn from 2011 to 2022. 
            These patterns seem to be tracing the global trends of declining global areas burned by wildfire. It is difficult to quantify whether this is good or bad however, considering how fires could have mixed impact on parks, its inhabitants, and the local communities that surround them.</p>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                    <figure style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

                </div>
            <p>Region-wise, while there is no clear pattern for the most part (attributable to too short a timeframe of observation), we could see a general increase in temperature in parks across different regions. 
            Most notably, Alaska shows significant increase of almost 10% since 2011 (most pronounced is Denali National Park, though not shown in the figure). 
            This suggests how geographical properties could lead to parks being affected disproportionately by climate change, how Alaska stands at the forefront of global warming, and how parks are especially sensitive to it.</p>

            <p>American Samoa National Park experiences a surge in precipitation/rainfall throughout the period observed of just 10 years. 
            This radical change in rain patterns within national parks are especially indicative of how the area as a whole is impacted by climate change, and has great implications on how the communities in it could be put at risk (in this case: rising sea level, flooding… that affect coastal resilience of the park and its inhabitants alike).</p>

            <p>The graph shows the changes in the number of visitors to national parks from 2011 to 2022 seems to follow budget spent on parks for corresponding years. 
            There appears to be a general upward trend in visitation, suggesting an increasing interest in national parks. This could be due to various factors, such as the rising popularity of outdoor activities, improvements in park accessibility, or enhanced awareness and promotion of national parks. Like visitation trend, spending also shows an upward trajectory, which likely correlates with the increase in visitors, which is shown in the correlation heatmap.
            When comparing the averages from 2020-2022 with those before 2020, we see a post-pandemic surge in visitation never seen before at national parks, peaking in 2021 with over 9.1 million visits across all parks.</p>

            <p>Noticing an interesting correlation between deferred maintenance and repairs (DMR) and visitation, we ran a regression analysis of DMR on visitation across parks, controlling for spending. The model’s variables are able to explain 66.2% of the variation in DMR in parks. Using log-log regression, we are able to interpret the result such that an increase of 1% in visitation is associated with an 0.38% increase in DMR, controlling for spending (statistically significant). 
            Because DMR is closely tied with visits to parks and can have important implications to parks’ state (for example, surges in visit can expose parks to downgraded facilities and impairment that could interfere with its ecosystem), this could be useful in assessing the problem of overcrowding at parks, how park infrastructures could be put at risk, and how budget allocation could be calibrated based on individual parks’ rate of increase in visitation.</p>

            <p>The index was constructed using factor analysis method, where variables’ common variance is examined to identify the optimally weighted linear combination of factors. 
            As dimensions/variables are reduced, an aggregate score is produced based on these weighted factors to describe different aspects of the dataset.</p>

            The model’s five factors that come out of these variables is able to explain 61.25% of variability in the original dataset.
            The parks that are scored lowest in the system reflect the observations made above. Interestingly, while orphaned wells metric is not included in the final list of indicators used to construct the index, Theodore Roosevelt and Channel Island have the densest concentration of orphaned wells littered within parks’ 30 miles vicinity, hinting at potential health metrics that we are not yet able to capture with existing indicators with this model.</p>

            <p>A few interesting observations: Highest average score of above 0.6 goes to the Eastern regions of the United States, though not overperforming their Midwest and Intermountain counterparts by a significant amount. Alaska has the lowest average composite scores across parks and with considerably lower index (barely making it past 0.5) than the rest of the regions, most likely due to significant climate change impact, shown most prominently through the spike in average temperature. Pacific West’s scores are on the lower side likely for similar reasons, apparent by relatively heightened fire activities, and rising temperature. In addition, this region contains parks that are among those with highest visit rates in 2015.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>From DMR measures, we see that overcrowding and downgraded infrastructure have considerable implication to parks’ wellbeing and not just visitors’ enjoyment.</p>
        <p>CWhile climate change is generally not reflected per parks over such a short period of time, we see that some parks located at certain areas are impacted more severely than others. More attention should be drawn to these (islands, northwest), as it not only affects parks’ well-being, but also the local community that surrounds it.</p>
        <p>Parks scores are distributed with slight distinctions across regions. While most parks (71%) seem to be performing above average with a nice left-skewed shaped bell, a selected few have their indexes at comparatively low extremes and could potentially hint at the need for closer examination and countermeasures in this riskier areas of the national parks system.</p>
