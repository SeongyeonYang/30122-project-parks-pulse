^{1} Represents Full-Time Equivalents (FTE) funded from park base operating dollars.
^{2} Total FTE shown for parks in the ""Operation of the National Park System"" account are by organization, irrespective of funding source. For example, some temporary positions in
parks are funded from construction, recreation fees, etc.
^{3} When different from previously listed levels, the FY 2012 Enacted amounts reflect presentation adjustments or shifts of funds within reprogramming guidelines, in effect, the FY 2012
Final numbers. A full-year 2013 appropriation for this account was not enacted at the time the budget was prepared; therefore, this account is operating under a continuing resolution
(P.L.112-175). The amounts included for 2013 reflect the annualized level provided by the continuing resolution.
^{4} With the 2013 implementation of the new Financial and Business Management System (FBMS), budget consolidation of units primarily operated through other units was considered.
Since function sharing was already occurring, the budget consolidation was reasonable and efficient. These 2013 budget consolidations were: Arlington House, Clara Barton NHS, and
Theodore Roosevelt Island NMem under George Washington Memorial Parkway; Presidio under Golden Gate NRA; Natchez Trace NST under the Natchez Trace Parkway/Brices
Crossroads NBS/Tupelo NB group; and Baltimore-Washington Parkway, Carter G. Woodson Home NHS, Fort Washington Park, Frederick Douglass NHS, Greenbelt Park, and Mary
McLeod Bethune Council House NHS under National Capital Parks-East and Ford's Theater NHS under National Mall and Memorial Parks..
^{5} This unit is currently authorized but not officially established; it is not included in the count of NPS units. (As of March 25, 2013, three new national monuments were added, bring
the park unit count to 401.)
^{6} The National Trail System includes three units that are designated as park units. The two that have budget allocations are additionally listed here, in brackets, to show the total
National Trail System budget level.
^{7} The NPS uses these totals when responding to inquiries as to the amount of funding directly available for ""park base operations."" Items which follow this total also support park
operations, but are managed at the Regional or Servicewide level.",,
