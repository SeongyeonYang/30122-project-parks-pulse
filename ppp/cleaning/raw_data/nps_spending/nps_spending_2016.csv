^{1} Represents Full-Time Equivalents (FTE) funded from park base operating dollars.
^{2} Total FTE shown for parks in the ""Operation of the National Park System"" account are by organization, irrespective of funding source. For example, some temporary positions in parks are funded from construction, recreation fees,
etc.
^{3} When different from previously listed levels, the FY 2014 Final amounts reflect presentation adjustments or shifts of funds within reprogramming guidelines. NOTE: The FY 2015 Omnibus Bill required the NPS to present an Ops
Plan for the Operation of the National Park System (ONPS) Appropriation; this column reflects that Ops Plan.
^{4} With the 2013 implementation of the new Financial and Business Management System (FBMS), budget consolidation of units primarily operated through other units was considered. Since function sharing was already occurring,
the budget consolidation was reasonable and efficient. These 2013 budget consolidations were: Arlington House, Clara Barton NHS, and Theodore Roosevelt Island NMem under George Washington Memorial Parkway; Presidio
under Golden Gate NRA; Natchez Trace NST under the Natchez Trace Parkway/Brices Crossroads NBS/Tupelo NB group; and Baltimore-Washington Parkway, Carter G. Woodson Home NHS, Fort Washington Park, Frederick
Douglass NHS, Greenbelt Park, Mary McLeod Bethune Council House NHS, under National Capital Parks-East and Ford's Theater NHS under National Mall and Memorial Parks.
^{5} This unit is currently authorized but not officially established; it is not included in the count of NPS units. (As of December 19, 2014, four new units were added, bringing the park unit count to 405.)
^{6} The National Trail System includes three units that are designated as park units. The two that have separate budget allocations are additionally listed here, in brackets, to show the total National Trail System budget level.
^{7} The NPS uses these totals when responding to inquiries as to the amount of funding directly available for ""park base operations."" Items which follow this total also support park operations, but are managed at the Regional or
Servicewide level.
^{8} Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad NM includes funding for Harriet Tubman NHP, which is a separate authorized unit but is not officially established.
^{9} Funding for USPP Headquarters is reflected under Park Visitor Protection Support Functions.","","",""
